    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <l1>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</l1>

        <l1>1 cup buttermilk</l1>

        <l1>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</l1>

        <l1>1 teaspoon paprika</l1>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>

        <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>

        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>

        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
